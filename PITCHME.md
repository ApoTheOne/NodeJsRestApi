**TOPICS**
1.	GitHub  
2.	REST?  
3.	Creating RESTful Node.js API  
4.	Running Node.js APIs on production  

---

### GitHub
 - OSS
 - GitHub pages
 - Gists
 
---

### Representational state transfer
Architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

---

**REST Principles**
- Uniform interface |
- Clientâ€“server |
- Stateless |
- Cacheable |
- Layered system |
- Code on demand (optional) |  

---

**Content Negotiation**  

- In Node.js, HTTP response object contains a method **response.format()** which performs the content negotiation based on the **Accept** HTTP headers if set in the request object.  
- It uses built in **Request.accepts()** to select appropriate handler for the request.  
- If that is not found, the server invokes default handler, which resonds with HTTP 406 Not acceptable.  

---
Code Sample:
```
app.get('/users', function(request, response) {
 response.format( {
  'text/xml' : function() {
     response.send(users.getUserInXML());
    },
  'application/json' : function() {
     JSON.stringify(users.getUserInJson());
    },
  'default' : function() {
     response.status(406).send('Not Acceptable');
    }
});
```

---

HTTP Request Headers: 
- Accept
 - MIME Types
- Accept-Language
- Accept-Encoding
```
GET /users/anurag
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-IN,en-GB;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7
```
---

Response Header  
```
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

---

**Cross Origin Resource Sharing**  
 The HTTP request headers are as follows:
- Origin: This defines where the actual request originates from  
- Access-Control-Request-Method: This defines the method that should be
used for the actual request  
- Access-Control-Request Header: This defines the headers that should be
used in the actual request   
---

Valid CORS HTTP response headers start with Access-Control-Allow:
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin* : This is a required header in all valid CORS
responses. It either echoes the origin of the actual host that request has been
made from, if that is the only origin allowed to access the resource, or * if it
can be accessed from any host.  
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods* : This is a required header. It lists all the
allowed HTTP methods supported by the server providing the resource.  
required headers*
---

- Access-Control-Allow-Headers*: This is a required header. If the request
contains Access-Control-Request-Headers, then it provides a comma separated
list of all the headers accepted by the server providing the
resource.  
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: This is an optional header used to
indicate that cookies should be included in the CORS request.  
required headers*
---

- Access-Control-Expose-Headers: This is an optional header. Its value is a
comma-separated list of headers that should be exposed to the client.
- Access-Control-Max-Age: This is an optional header that allows you to
cache the response for the value specified by it.

---
[Sample code](https://github.com/ApoTheOne/PPOC/blob/master/NodeJsApi/app.js)
```
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization");
    if(req.method === 'OPTIONS'){
        res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE');
        return res.status(200).json({});
    }
    next();
});
```
